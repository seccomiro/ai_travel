Plan a trip for me, departing from Curitiba, at December 26th, 2025.
My wife and I want to visit Puerto Madryn, Ushuaia, Torres del Paine, Mount Fitz Roy, Bariloche and Mendoza. We're going to drive, only during daytime.
Do not plan segments that would last more than 10h (stops counting) or 800km.
We plan to spend a week in Uhsuaia, and some days at the national parks. We also already have a reservation in Bariloche from January 18th to February 15th.
