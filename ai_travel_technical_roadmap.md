# 🗺️ Technical Roadmap – AI Travel Planning Platform

## 🔰 Phase 0: Project Initialization (Week 1)

### ✅ Objectives
- Prepare environment, repositories, CI/CD pipeline, and internal documentation.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Set up version control (GitHub/GitLab).
- [ ] Set up Ruby on Rails 8 project with PostgreSQL and Redis.
- [ ] Install and configure Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus).
- [ ] Set up Sidekiq for background jobs.
- [ ] Configure `rspec-rails`, `factory_bot_rails`, `shoulda-matchers`, `webmock`, and `simplecov`.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) with tests and linting.
- [ ] Add default internationalization files and language switcher.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Application & User System (Weeks 2–3)

### ✅ Objectives
- Implement base trip model, user authentication, and basic dashboard UI.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Set up user authentication (Devise) with OAuth (Google, Apple).
- [ ] Design database schema: `users`, `trips`, `segments`, `preferences`, `chat_messages`.
- [ ] Implement user dashboard and trip creation flow.
- [ ] Enable full i18n on all front-end elements (locale switcher, fallback, translation YAMLs).
- [ ] Scaffold chat interface with Turbo Streams.

## 💬 Phase 2: Interactive Chat & LLM Integration (Weeks 4–5)

### ✅ Objectives
- Enable LLM-based interaction for travel planning using chat and real-time updates.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Implement AI chat backend:
  - Support for context-aware, stateful sessions.
  - Store full conversation history.
- [ ] Integrate LLM provider (OpenAI, Mistral, Claude).
- [ ] Design prompt builder (system prompt, context, history, user input).
- [ ] Internationalize prompts dynamically based on user locale.
- [ ] Implement initial AI Tools: route planner, time/distance estimator (Google Maps API).
- [ ] Build side panel UI for displaying current trip plan (Stimulus controller).

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: AI Tools & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) (Weeks 6–7)

### ✅ Objectives
- Implement external data tools and a knowledge base for dynamic, accurate suggestions.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Configure pgvector or vector DB (Weaviate, Qdrant).
- [ ] ETL pipeline for ingesting structured and unstructured data:
  - Travel guides, fuel prices, road conditions, tourism data.
- [ ] Implement semantic search on the vector DB.
- [ ] Add AI tools for:
  - Lodging (Booking.com, Airbnb)
  - Weather forecasts
  - Currency exchange and ATM locations
  - Attractions, tours, points of interest

---

## 🧩 Phase 4: Personalization Engine & Onboarding (Weeks 8–9)

### ✅ Objectives
- Learn user preferences automatically and suggest pre-configured trips or defaults.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Create initial onboarding flow to collect travel style, budget, and interests via chat.
- [ ] Build preference engine that adapts based on behavior and past input.
- [ ] Store inferred preferences in user profile and use them in prompt generation.
- [ ] Add “learning” mechanisms to update preferences after each trip/chat session.

---

## 🌍 Phase 5: Finalization Features & Offline Support (Weeks 10–11)

### ✅ Objectives
- Finalize UX, add guide generation, offline access, sharing, and checklist.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Implement full trip guide export (PDF/HTML).
- [ ] Add interactive checklist (generated dynamically from trip data).
- [ ] Add collaboration & sharing options:
  - Read-only guide link
  - Co-editing invitations
- [ ] Add offline support (PWA or local storage fallback).
- [ ] Add admin dashboard for tracking usage, errors, and content feedback.

---

## 🧪 Phase 6: Testing, QA & Launch Preparation (Week 12)

### ✅ Objectives
- Final QA and stabilization before launch.

### 📌 Tasks
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all critical components:
  - Models, Services, Controllers, Chat logic, AI tools.
- [ ] Run manual testing across locales and devices.
- [ ] Optimize loading, latency, and AI usage cost.
- [ ] Final review of i18n coverage.
- [ ] Launch beta for selected users and monitor feedback.

---

## 📈 Ongoing & Post-MVP (Beyond Week 12)

- [ ] Add user billing and subscription plans.
- [ ] Introduce itinerary templates.
- [ ] Integrate airline/train ticket APIs.
- [ ] Add more advanced AI personas (e.g., budget optimizer, local guide expert).
- [ ] Expand multilingual support beyond interface (e.g., translated tour links).
- [ ] Implement AI-based itinerary scoring and comparison.
